# Download Images from CSV using Python Script

This Python script, `download_images.py`, is designed to download images from a CSV file containing URLs. The CSV file should be named `urls.csv`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `requests`

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your CSV file (`urls.csv`) contains a column with the header `url` that contains the URLs of the images you want to download.
2. Run the script `download_images.py` using the following command:
   ```
   python download_images.py
   ```
3. The script will read the URLs from the CSV file, download the corresponding images, and save them to the current directory.

## Example CSV Format
